INSTALLATION

To install g, just copy it
somewhere, e.g. like this:
sudo cp g /usr/local/lib/g
Next, make sure you source
it inside /etc/bash.bashrc
or ~/.bashrc (/etc/profile
won't work here, however):
echo "source /usr/local/"\
"lib/g" >>/etc/bash.bashrc


CONFIGURATION

When you type `g foo', g will search for the directive in ~/.g or
in /etc/g. It will stop looking on the first occurence. The files
contain the directive definitions, one per line. Each line begins
with the directive name, then there is a space, and then the bash
command to be executed with arguments. It's fairly simple really.


EXAMPLE

Put the following in ~/.g:
hello echo "Hello, world!"
Type `g hello' to test it.


NAME

The name `g' is short for `go' -- the optimization reduces typing of
the command name by one half, increasing productivity exponentially!


AUTHOR

g has been created by cheater00 at gmail in 2011. It always annoyed
me having to type in long paths and complicated commands again, and
again, and again -- so here's a solution. I hope you will enjoy it!
